            <h2>Any% Speedrun guia</h2>
            <p>As rotas variam de acordo com a categoria e o jogo, mas geralmente envolvem:</p>
            <ul>
                FDTs<br>
                This game has Frame-Dependent-Tricks or FDTS that require high framerates to complete. This means
                that<br>
                you must have a computer capable of high framerates to do these tricks. Lower refresh rates can help<br>
                improve FDTs, but might not work for everyone. Test FDTs before committing to learning this run as
                they<br>
                won’t work on every computer. FDTs are used in Any% and any category using story mode.<br><br>

                General Knowledge<br>
                Progress Saving<br>
                In this game there are progress checkpoints that save your progress. Saving isn’t currently useful
                in<br>
                this speedrun, but even when playing on continue without saving, you can store your progress and
                exit<br>
                and reenter a level at a checkpoint. If you softlock and are forced to exit the level, you can still<br>
                store progress to skip previously watched cutscenes and reenter the beginning of the room at the<br>
                checkpoint.<br>
                Location Panels<br>
                In Lego Gotham City, there are location panels at main locations of the city. Once activated these<br>
                panels will play a cutscene showcasing a villain character in Gotham City. After, activated panels
                can<br>
                be teleported to using the map in the Batcave or through other activated panels. Some location
                panels<br>
                must be activated by using laser vision or The Flash.<br>
                Red Bricks<br>
                Unfortunately most Red Bricks are locked during the story. This is because most Red Bricks must be<br>
                unlocked as Lex Luthor, The Joker, or The Riddler which are unplayable in the hub during the story.<br>
                Invincibility, Fall Rescue, and Super Build are all locked during the story.<br>
                Vehicle Missions<br>
                During all vehicle missions use 2 players to deal max damage against enemy vehicles. This isn’t really
                a<br>
                skip or trick but should be used to save time.<br>
                Hub Characters<br>
                During the entire story you can only play as either Batman and Robin or as Batman and Superman in
                the<br>
                hub except during one part. In between Harbouring a Criminal and Arkham Asylum Antics, there is a
                brief<br>
                time where you can play as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. You can unlock other characters during the<br>
                story, but cannot play as them in the hub until you have completed the story.<br>
                Hub FDTS<br>
                Pause launches in the hub don’t work for Batman and Robin outside of the Batcave. For some reason in
                the<br>
                hub, after completing a pause launch, Robin and Batman are forced back down in a gliding animation.<br>
                However, pause flying still works for these characters.<br>
                Suit Unlocking<br>
                Batman and Robin suits are locked in the hub until they have been unlocked in the story.<br>
                Clipping<br>
                Clipping works better with v-sync on as you will not get launched or pushed back as easily when
                clipping<br>
                with it on.<br><br>

                Tricks (Not all used)<br>
                Pause Fly - PF: https://youtu.be/l57JL0DD7_c<br>
                FDT<br>
                (V-sync off) Spam pause on a controller (not keyboard) while moving in a certain direction to “glide”
                in<br>
                the air while losing little height. You can rapidly pause fly by spamming pause on controller and<br>
                keyboard at the same time to lose even less height.<br>
                Pause Launch - PL: https://youtu.be/ATeZqnbbL0Y<br>
                FDT<br>
                (V-sync 30-hz) Attack or jump roll on an upwards-sloped object, pause the game, and turn v-sync off.<br>
                This is more precise but takes more time.<br>
                (V-sync off) Attack or jump roll on an upwards-sloped object, Alt+Tab out and back into the game or<br>
                Ctrl+Alt+Dlt followed by Esc, then immediately pause the game and unpause it. This takes less time
                but<br>
                is less precise. Alt+Tab method can whitescreen or basically crash the game.<br>
                Friend Grab Pause Launch: https://youtu.be/rWezHwh4IdI<br>
                FDT<br>
                Grab an invincible player on a slope, and complete the steps for a pause launch, and both players
                will<br>
                launch into the air.<br>
                Fly Fall Rescue - FFR: https://youtu.be/H5BDbM4xMn4<br>
                (Using a flying character) Jump off a desired point to a fall plane, press special and follow it with
                an<br>
                attack. This will make the character be rescued back to the original point.<br>
                Fly Fall Rescue Cancel - FFR Cancel: https://youtu.be/nkEQadUxPfM<br>
                (Using a flying character with heat vision) Perform an FFR and cancel it midway by holding attack to<br>
                activate heat vision and stop the FFR. (Using FFR cancels to clip into things usually works better
                with<br>
                v-sync on.)<br>
                Camera Shield: https://youtu.be/ad-l3Id_MRc<br>
                As invisible Sensor Suit Batman, shield a visible character from activating a camera by standing in<br>
                between the camera and the visible character.<br>
                Slow Fall Glide: https://youtu.be/qqr1a-Y6-LE<br>
                As Bat Suit Batman you can fall slower while gliding by spamming jump instead of holding jump.<br>
                Electricity Clip: https://youtu.be/NfSBa73yKMY<br>
                Have a character die of electricity to clip through a wall. (Works better with v-sync on)<br>
                AI Warp: https://youtu.be/GnrhRBEZqxQ<br>
                Drop a player out and have the AI move a character to another area.<br>
                Wall Jump: https://youtu.be/KauT9L9wg2s<br>
                Spam jumps on certain walls to go up the wall.<br>
                Trigger Clip: https://youtu.be/IXwl9Wm2VY0<br>
                (V-sync on) When below a room trigger as a flying character, spam jump and special to clip through
                the<br>
                trigger barrier and hit the trigger.<br>
                Ground Pound: https://youtu.be/pXHFf9-tJjY<br>
                Some characters can break things through walls or floors by pressing jump and attack near the
                breakable<br>
                object.<br>
                Friend Grab Clip: https://youtu.be/hxTh6-eX2pU<br>
                Using the free extra Friend Grab, players can clip other players through some walls by pressing
                special.<br>
                Hover Punch: https://youtu.be/gWClpgnII14<br>
                As a flying character, when on a fall plane, spam punch to avoid being lifted up to the surface.<br>
                Freeze Clip: https://youtu.be/leErxHz7G-I<br>
                Freezing an environment behind a player, or freezing a player can be used to clip out of areas.
                (Works<br>
                better with v-sync on)<br>
                Camera Pan Skip - CPS: https://youtu.be/MazwMzr8eog, https://youtu.be/phFXklYzFXM<br>
                With one player dropped in, rapidly switch characters or drop in player 2 to skip some camera
                pans.<br><br>

                Story Skips<br>
                Start<br>
                Start with v-sync off so you can PF in R2.<br>
                Play on continue without saving to remove time loss of the game saving.<br>
                (Optional Recommendation) Use a double controller setup because PF does not work on keyboard and
                there<br>
                are parts in the run where both players should PF at the same time for fastest strats.<br>
                (Use a lower refresh rate if needed to get better PF and PL.)<br><br>

                1-Theatrical Pursuits: https://youtu.be/4trQETTYYys<br>
                R1:<br>
                Stand on the trapdoor while getting the final batarang hit on Harley Quinn, and spam jump when she
                sends<br>
                you back to the side of the trapdoor to jump into the R2 trigger before the cutscene plays.<br>
                R2:<br>
                After breaking the tuba that The Riddler is hiding in, do a double jump with Robin to get on top of
                the<br>
                black rock and trigger the camera pan with Batman as Robin climbs up the grapple hook. PF to jump
                across<br>
                the gap as Robin and knock down the black box.<br>
                Camera Shield as Batman to stop the camera from activating as you move Robin to the curtains area.
                At<br>
                the curtains, jump off nearby objects to grapple onto the hooks without pausing to aim at them.<br>
                Keep Robin near the curtain area while Batman fights The Riddler to prevent the boss from jumping<br>
                around.<br>
                R3:<br>
                After unlocking the acrobat suit (not necessary in replay story) change back into normal Robin and
                PL+PF<br>
                off the front black table or the red ropes with Batman to get Robin on top of the Chandelier and
                Batman<br>
                on top of the second floor. (Be careful and do not hit the Two-Face boss trigger too early.)<br>
                Move Robin to the door at the top and hit the Two-Face fight by moving backwards as Batman. Quickly<br>
                after hitting the trigger, double jump as Robin to hit the R4 trigger as the door opens before the<br>
                Two-Face cutscene plays. (If you miss the cutscene skip, but the door stays open, then you can move<br>
                forward when the cutscene is over. Otherwise you must complete the Two-Face fight or reset.)<br>
                R4:<br>
                Hub 1-2: https://youtu.be/58UQjWcj6b4<br>
                After calling in the Helicopter as Batman, if you stand next to the Helicopter call-in-point as
                Robin,<br>
                you can spam switch characters as Robin to jump into the helicopter early before the cutscene
                plays.<br><br>

                2-Harbouring a Criminal: https://youtu.be/pf8rmca4aM4<br>
                R1:<br>
                PL + PF as Magnet Suit Robin and Power Suit Batman to get the two missing Helicopter set pieces. (If
                you<br>
                start pulling as Batman a bit before using magnets as Robin, you can manage to trigger both set
                pieces<br>
                falling at the same time.)<br>
                R2:<br>
                Do a PL as Robin on top of the fireworks box to get on top of the carnival building.<br>
                Hub 2-3: https://youtu.be/vWhJqE1MLl8<br>
                Use a car to get to the corner of the parking lot that is towards the water and away from the
                carnival.<br>
                Jump off the car to the lower metal fence and jump over it. Then climb over the hill into a white
                van<br>
                and drive it to the Batcave call-in-point.<br>
                When traveling to Arkham Asylum, take a left on the street to Botanic Gardens to take a shorter route
                to<br>
                Arkham instead of following the ghost studs.<br><br>

                3-Arkham Asylum Antics: https://youtu.be/5EoczgzEhOU<br>
                R1:<br>
                CPS to skip the Catwoman cutscene<br>
                PF+PL as Batman to lower the hat and build the Power Suit. Trigger the grapple to activate Robin’s<br>
                Acrobat Suit after blowing up the silver statue blocking Catwoman’s path.<br>
                Jump on the gray block in the top right as Robin to jump over the spiked fence.<br>
                After breaking the brick statue as Bat Suit Batman, break the glass floor that is lower in the maze.<br>
                Then change back into the power suit. Jump from the rock debris to the wood platform as Robin and AI<br>
                warp Batman.<br>
                Hub 3-4: https://youtu.be/EjGkJHKq2Xc<br><br><br>


                4-Arkham Assignment: https://youtu.be/lbAWdVoL0iA<br>
                R1:<br>
                Stand on the railing of the stairs as Hazard Suit Robin and PF over to the other platform.<br>
                PL+PF as charged up Electricity Suit Batman over the fan and ground pound towards the fan to break
                the<br>
                machine powering it.<br>
                PL+PF as Batman and Robin on the edge railing to get up to the flooded area.<br>
                PL+PF as Batman and Robin on the sloped bricks to get up to Mr. Freeze’s cell.<br>
                PL+PF as Batman and Robin to get up to the elevator.<br>
                R2:<br>
                PL+PF as Batman on top of the elevator to deactivate the camera early. Then, use Robin’s water to<br>
                extinguish the fires.<br>
                After switching to Robin’s Acrobat Suit and Batman’s Sensor Suit, PF right after getting out of the<br>
                radioactive corridor to get over to the overgrown cell.<br>
                In the Scarecrow fight, during some point, jump as Robin off of the oval tube onto the wooden bar
                above.<br>
                (Remember to build the wheel onto the ovular tube when Scarecrow is at 3 hearts so you can activate
                the<br>
                levers.)<br>
                After activating one lever, PF to get to the other lever.<br>
                Hub 4-5: https://youtu.be/VNNhpbrxSJM<br>
                Return to the Batcave as Batman and call in Robin’s Motorcycle and drive to Ace’s Chemicals.<br><br>

                5-Chemical Crisis: https://youtu.be/Q448TDCzNyE<br>
                R1:<br>
                PF as Robin to get past the gate.<br>
                Jump roll at the stairs to get more distance before the cutscene plays.<br>
                PF at the edge of the water to get past the fence.<br>
                PL+PF at the stair to get up the elevated area.<br>
                PF over the green goo to get to the metal stand and PL off of the edge of the one of the black
                pillars.<br>
                PF on top of the green tech block to get over the purple goo.<br>
                When moving past the metal barrels, PF to get to the next area.<br>
                PL+PF off of the stairs next to the electrical panel to get over the second green goo area.<br>
                PF to get past the metal fence.<br>
                PL+PF off of the blue pipes and hug the wall while doing so to get to the forklift area without<br>
                activating the forklift cutscene. (There is quite a large area where the forklift cutscene will
                trigger,<br>
                so you might want to check this out in Free Play to see how to avoid it first).<br>
                Forklift Clip: Jump into the forklift while clipping through the floor below it.<br>
                R2:<br>
                Change into the Electrical Suit as Batman and PF to the other platform.<br>
                Take the electricity from the electric panel and PL off of the ball platform and PF to the nearest
                tank.<br>
                PF to the next tank and PF off of that to the next platform.<br>
                PL+PF at the metal stairs to the square floating metal platform. PF from that to the metal stairs to

                batarang on the upper hook, and Batman’s sonar gun on the bottom. This will save time as the
                cutscenes<br>
                of the objects deactivating will overlap.<br>

                Do an AI warp with Batman with the Power Suit and blow up the silver objects. Change back into the<br>
                normal suit and do the AI warp again.<br>
                R2:<br>
                Do an Electricity Clip to get OOB at the front wall as Batman.<br>
                Rapid PF to the left wall.<br>
                PF off of the wall and move right and down to hit the trigger. (If you fail hitting the trigger and
                end<br>
                up back in bounds, try to take an electricity death without moving but jumping. This way, you might<br>
                spawn OOB back where you pause launched.)<br>
                Fly right as Superman until the camera position changes and then fly backwards. Once the camera
                changes<br>
                again, fly right until you reach the second area.<br>
                Fly right from the edge of the second area until the camera changes and then fly backwards again.
                Once<br>
                the camera changes again, fly right for about 16 seconds. After this time has passed, move forward
                and<br>
                the camera should pan to the end of the third area. Pop in bounds behind the gold wall and hit the<br>

                In the robot fight, activate the cutscene a little to the left of the center of the arena. This
                should<br>
                force the robot to slam in the wall everytime as long as the player’s robot hugs the top left as the<br>
                enemy robot charges. (Make sure player 2 is dropped out, because sometimes the robot will target
                player<br>
